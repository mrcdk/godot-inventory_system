# Godot basic inventory system

A basic inventory system made with Godot that doesn't really work as an inventory or isn't really a system. It's pretty basic so that's a thing I guess.

This isn't a tutorial or a "how to". There are better ways to do this...and there are worse ways... This is one way to do it.

I won't work on this anymore, it was just to see how long it would take me to do it. I thought it would take me a couple of days to get something working but it only took me 4 hours.

It should work on Godot 3.0

I didn't make any of the graphics or fonts. The graphics and font credits are:
